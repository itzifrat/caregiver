<p id="sect_5"><strong>5. Use of Information by Other Users</strong>
<p><strong>5.1. With all Site Visitors and Registered Users </strong><br>
If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, we share with Site visitors and Registered Users the information that you include in a job posting or provider profile (not including your contact information), as well as the following registration information, which we may include in your job posting or provider profile: your first name, first initial of your last name, city, province or territory, profile picture, and if you are a Care Provider, your gender and age may be made available to certain Registered Users unless you elect to opt-out of sharing that information. With certain exceptions, you choose how much detail you want to include in either your job posting or your provider profile; the more information you share, however, the better chance you have of finding either care or a job that works for you. We may also share on your provider profile or job posting whether you have connected to Care.com through Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. With Registered Users only</strong><br>
Care Provider reviews are made available to certain Registered Users. If you are a Care Provider, your phone number also will be visible to certain Registered Users if you elect to share it in your profile. In addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) may be made available to certain Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential.<br><br>

If you are a Care Provider, you will appear in certain search result listings if you match the search criteria used by a Care Seeker. Similarly, you may appear in emails sent to Care Seekers in your area. In addition, if you are a Care Provider or a Care Seeker, you may appear in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area.<br><br><strong>If we terminate your registration for any reason, we reserve the right to send a notice of your termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe you have corresponded.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.3. With Listings in Google and Other Public Search Engines, and on third party websites</strong><br>
In an effort to further facilitate your ability to find a caregiver or find a job, selected information contained in job postings and caregiver profiles by Care Seekers and Care Providers, which may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, job/provider description, may also be shared with third party search engines and other vendors who run classified advertising businesses, or with third party websites, and thus may be listed in third party web site search results (e.g., Google), and on third party websites which would make that information available to the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting. Members can opt-out of this sharing if they adjust their privacy settings and preferences on the Site at the following URL link: <a href="https://www.care.com/en-ca/my-account/account-settings/privacy-settings" target="_blank">https://www.care.com/en-ca/my-account/account-settings/privacy-settings</a>.</p></p>

<p id="sect_8"><strong>8. Accessing, Changing or Removing your Personal Information and Closing your Account</strong><br>
You may access, change, or remove Personal Information you provided when you registered by logging into your account and accessing your account settings. You can remove some of the Personal Information you have posted on the Site, such as information you posted in profiles and job postings, by editing or deleting that item in the profile or jobs area of your account.<br><br>

To access, change or remove Personal Information not accessible through your account settings, profiles and job postings, contact Member Care at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mcimprint-en@care.com">mcimprint-en@care.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to reasonably accommodate your request to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. For example, we will not remove messages that you have sent to others through the Site or the Services even if you close your account.<br><br>

Personal Information that you post may have been captured and archived by search engines. This Personal Information (including job postings) may remain searchable on the Internet even after you or we delete it.<br><br>

If you no longer wish to participate in our Services you may contact Member Care at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mcimprint-en@care.com">mcimprint-en@care.com</a> and request that your account be closed. If your Care.com account is closed, we will remove your name and other Personal Information from our publicly viewable database. Please note that we may delete any or all of your account information, which includes Personal Information, without liability unless otherwise specifically provided by applicable law.<br><br>

We will retain your Personal Information if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse. We may also retain your Personal Information and Non Personal Information for business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, auditing our records, enforcing our rights and obligations under our agreements or if required by law. Care.com may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Registered Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send to others through Care.com to other Users, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that others have copied, may also remain visible. To the extent permitted by law, Care.com disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Care.com does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain job post or profile information that has since been removed from Care.com’s Site.</p>

<ul style="list-style:disc">
