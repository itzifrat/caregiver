<strong>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES; LIMITATIONS; USER RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>

<strong>1.1. About Our Services</strong>    
<br>    
Care.com’s mission is to provide an online venue for families and carers to connect with each other, arrange care, and share advice. We work to fulfill this mission by making available online communication tools, information, and an extended network of care seekers and carers that help our users find and coordinate quality care for children, seniors, pets and home. The Services we offer include, among others:    
<ul>    
<li>We enable individuals seeking care services such as child care, care for older people, pet care and housekeeping services (“Care Seekers”) to post jobs on the Site and individuals and entities who provide care services (“Carers”) to post profiles on the Site.</li>    
<li>We provide search tools to help Care Seekers find individual Carers that meet their specific needs and preferences and enable Care Seekers and individual Carers to communicate through a private messaging platform without sharing personal identification or contact information.</li><li>We provide tools and information to help Care Seekers and Carers make informed decisions, such as (i) our safety centre, which includes a safety guide and safety resources, and (ii) a process for Care Seekers to obtain reference checks on Carers who consent to the running and sharing of those checks.</li>    
</ul>    
<br>    
Our Services continue to grow and change. Please refer to our Site for further information about the Services we provide.    
<br>    
<br>    
<strong>1.2. Limitations of Our Services</strong>    
<br>    
We offer an online forum that among other things enables Carers to post profiles and interact with Care Seekers for potential employment opportunities.    
<br>    
<br>    
However, we do not employ any Carers nor are we an employment agency or a recruitment agency for any Carer or Care Seeker. We do not provide referral services. We do not charge Carers or Care Seekers a fee, a commission or other compensation based on a decision to, or not to, enter into an employment or independent contractor arrangement.    
<br>    
<br>    
Except as described in these Terms and the Data Policy, we do not verify, review, evaluate, interview, screen, vet or perform background checks on Carers or Care Seekers nor do we verify any content posted to the Site by a Carer, Care Seeker or others.    
<br>    
<br>    
We are not a party to any agreement between a Carer and a Care Seeker. Care Seekers are the potential employers of Carers and are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable employment standards legislation (including minimum wage laws), occupational health and safety legislation, and worker’s compensation insurance or benefit programs).    
<br>    
<br>    
There are risks, including but not limited to risk of physical harm, when you deal with someone you connect with through our Site. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other persons with whom you come in contact through the Site.

We do not refer or recommend either Care Seekers or Carers nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, and accuracy of the services provided by Carers or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Care Seekers or Carers whether in public, private or offline interactions.

Do not rely on this limited screening as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the individual’s or entity’s suitability as an employer or care provider.

You may cancel your subscription by emailing Care.com Member Care or adjusting your account settings. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. Your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your credit card will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up as a Premium Member.    
<br>    
<br>    
You acknowledge and agree that the Services are made available to you immediately as soon as you complete your Premium Membership subscription purchase, and therefore that your right to withdraw from your purchase within 7 working days of the date of purchase will be lost once your purchase is completed.    
<br>    
<br>    
<strong>8.3 Billing and Payment for Carers</strong>    
<br>    
Certain Services and offerings made available to Carers may require the payment of a fee by such Carers as described hereon or otherwise on the Site. To the extent you elect to purchase other chargeable Services and offerings, you authorize Care.com to charge your chosen payment provider for the Services you purchase.    
<br>    
<br>    
Care.com may allow Carers to pay a fee to be featured more prominently on the Site. In addition, Care.com may give Carers the ability to purchase credits that can be used by such Carers to exchange information with certain Care Seekers. To the extent applicable, the number of credits necessary to contact a Care Seeker and the expiration date of such credits is disclosed on the Site. Such credits do not have any monetary value and do not constitute a pre funding of stored value that can be used in the future. More information about credits can be found <a href="https://ca.care.com/carer-faq/#petcarefaq_6">here</a>.    
<br>    
<br>    
<strong>8.4 Refund Policy</strong>    
<br>    
To the extent permitted by law, Care.com does not as a general rule provide refunds or credits for subscription or other purchase cancellations. However, Care.com may in its sole discretion issue refunds or credits when it believes they are warranted.    
<br>    
<br>    
<strong>8.5 Free Trial Offers</strong>    
<br>    
Care.com may offer limited-time free trial Premium Membership subscriptions to Care Seekers from time-to-time. Care Seekers who sign up for Care.com Premium Membership on a free trial basis may have limited access to the features of the Site. If a Care Seeker does not cancel their subscription prior to the end of the free trial period, the Care Seeker will be charged the price then in effect for a monthly subscription to the Service, unless otherwise provided to him or her when he or she originally subscribed. To avoid being charged for Premium Membership services, a Care Seeker with a free trial subscription must cancel their subscription prior to the end of the free trial period.
